"""Event hooks — extension point for downstream projects.

Core modules emit events (ingested, compiled, etc.) at key lifecycle points.
Downstream projects register callbacks to react — e.g. pushing state to a
remote sync table, triggering a CI pipeline, sending a notification.

Usage from a downstream project (e.g. 华藏阁 startup)::

    from llmwiki.hooks import register
    register("ingested", lambda source, work_id, **kw: sync.push(source, work_id))
    register("compiled", lambda source, work_id, **kw: sync.mark(source, work_id))

Hooks are best-effort: exceptions are logged but never propagate to the
caller, so a broken hook cannot disrupt core operations.
