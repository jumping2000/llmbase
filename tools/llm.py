    question "how many input characters can I feed the LLM before its
    output budget overflows?":

        safe_chars = int(max_tokens * safety / tokens_per_char)

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_tokens : int
        Output token budget for the LLM call (the ``max_tokens`` you'll
        pass to :func:`chat` / :func:`chat_with_meta`).
    tokens_per_char : float
        Expected **output tokens produced per input character**. A
        combined metric: model token density × prompt output-expansion
        factor. Measure empirically from real runs::

            tokens_per_char = mean(
                meta.usage["completion_tokens"] / len(chunk_text)
                for each (chunk_text, meta) in recent_sample
            )

        Rough baselines (verify against your own prompts):
        - CJK reasoning-model output with mild normalization: ~15-20
        - CJK non-reasoning LLM, translation/restatement: ~2-4
        - ASCII summarization: ~1-3

        siwen's 2026-04-21 post-mortem measured 17 for wenguan/taixu.
    safety : float, default 0.8
        Fraction of ``max_tokens`` to target. Leaves headroom for
        output variance — some chunks expand more than the mean.
        Values in (0, 1]; 0.7-0.9 typical.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        Safe input chunk size in characters. Always ``>= 1`` when the
        inputs are valid (callers slicing exactly at this size may
        still overflow on unlucky variance; that's what ``safety``
        buys you — tune it against real logs).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any input is non-positive, or ``safety`` is outside
        ``(0, 1]``.

    Examples
    --------
